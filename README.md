2. Quality of Visualizations and Explanations
The script generates three key visualizations, which are enhanced here for clarity and insight .Each visualization is described, along with its purpose and interpretation.
Missing Values Plot




```Two line plots display (1) the count of missing values per timestamp across 25 features and (2) the percentage of device downtime (missing values) for the last 8,700 records, calculated as 100 * NA_COUNT / 25.
The dataset has missing values in most features (e.g., 823 for zone1_temperature, 770 for zone1_humidity), with counts ranging from 666 to 823. The plot identifies periods of high missing data, which may indicate sensor failures or maintenance downtime. The percentage downtime plot (focused on recent data) highlights operational reliability, with peaks suggesting critical periods for investigation (e.g., equipment shutdowns in late 2016).```

Zone Temperature Boxplot
```A boxplot shows the distribution of temperatures across nine zones (zone1_temperature to zone9_temperature).
The dataset’s descriptive statistics don’t include zone temperature means, but missing values (666–823 per zone) suggest potential outliers or sensor issues. The boxplot likely reveals variability in temperature (e.g., some zones hotter due to equipment proximity), which influences energy consumption. Outliers may indicate cooling system failures.```


3. Practical Insights and Recommendations

```Based on the model’s performance (R²: 0.9501, RMSE: 31.93) and dataset characteristics, the following insights and recommendations are proposed for optimizing equipment energy consumption in the facility:

The high Test R² (0.9501) and reasonable RMSE (31.93, ~21.6% of the standard deviation of 147.95) indicate the model is reliable for predicting hourly energy consumption. Deploy it in a real-time dashboard to forecast equipment energy needs, enabling proactive load balancing and cost savings.

Focus on Recent Data: Lag features (1–24 hours) and rolling statistics are likely key predictors. Ensure sensors provide continuous, high-quality data for the past 24 hours to maintain prediction accuracy. Address missing data (up to 823 values in zone1_temperature) promptly to avoid imputation biases.

The dataset includes nine zone temperatures, with missing values suggesting sensor issues. High or variable temperatures (inferred from boxplot outliers) may increase cooling demands. Inspect zones with frequent outliers (e.g., zone1_temperature) for inefficient HVAC systems or equipment heat output, and prioritize upgrades.

The right-skewed lighting_energy distribution (median: 0.00, max: 86.00) indicates lights are often off, with peaks during specific hours. Use the model’s hour and is_weekend features to identify peak usage (e.g., 9 AM–5 PM weekdays) and install motion sensors or automated dimming to reduce unnecessary lighting energy.

The missing values plot shows periods of high device downtime. Correlating these with maintenance logs or external events  to identify causes. Implement redundant sensors to minimize data gaps.

 The model’s temporal features (hour, day_of_week, month) suggest consumption varies by time. Schedule high-energy equipment (e.g., heavy machinery) during off-peak electricity tariff hours (e.g., overnight) to reduce costs, using model forecasts to plan operations.
